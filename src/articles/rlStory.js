Most people meet RL through a wall of mathematics: Markov Decision Processes, transition dynamics, value functions, policy gradients. These are the bones, the scaffolding. But as I spend more time with them, I find myself drifting away from equations and toward something softer—storytelling.

Each RL agent feels like a protagonist, stumbling through its own unfinished story. Its path is a string of moments—scenes stitched together by choices, some hesitant, some bold. Rewards become the pulse of the narrative: when they come often, the story rushes forward, almost impatient; when they are rare, the world stretches out, and the agent must wander through long corridors of uncertainty, searching for meaning that might never arrive. Sparse rewards remind me of writing a novel where the ending is hidden, and you have to trust your own hands to keep moving, even when the pages are blank.

The agent’s struggle between exploration and exploitation feels like a character’s quiet dilemma: do you stay with what you know, or do you step into the dark, hoping for something more? When we shape reward functions, it’s as if we are drawing the boundaries of a world, deciding what matters and what is left in shadow. We become the silent authors, setting the rules for what stories can be told.

This way of seeing has started to seep into how I think about RL. I find myself wondering: what story is the agent trying to write with its actions? What invisible walls shape its world? How can I help it find a narrative that feels whole, not just a string of disconnected choices?

Lately, I’ve been watching these ideas unfold in robotics, where RL is no longer just a dance of numbers but something that breathes and moves in the world. Robots are not just lines of code—they are bodies, bound by gravity and friction, forced to learn through every stumble and collision. It feels like moving from scribbling stories in a notebook to building a universe where the characters must live with the weight of every choice.

For now, I am still learning the foundations—wrestling with the basics, letting them settle into something like intuition. But I keep looking toward generative RL, where agents are not just following a script but inventing their own ways of being. I want to see what happens when a robot learns to surprise itself, to reach for tools it was never taught to use, to become something more than the sum of its code.

That edge—the place where RL becomes generative—draws me in. If RL is a kind of storytelling, then this is where the story is written together. The agent is no longer just a character moving through someone else’s plot. It becomes a co-author, shaping its own journey, learning to be curious, to grow, to find meaning in the world it inhabits.
